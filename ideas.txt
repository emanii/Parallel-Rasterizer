- We want to end up with an array of cuda_tris, where a cuda_tri has three
   coordinates and three colors. So, Vector3 has to be slimmed down, and so
   does Triangle.

- BoundingBox has to go. Each Triangle won't know what its bounding box is by
   the time it gets to the GPU. Therefore, it'll have to calculate its
   bounding box *on* the GPU.
